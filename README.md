# Comp-Graphics-Visualization

**1.	How do I approach designing software?**

New design skills that my work on the project helped me craft were 2D and 3D figures. The use of OpenGL and the webinars helped me learn new skills. The skills learned can help me in the future if I decide to create 3D images or even video games.


**2.	How do I approach developing programs?**

Every week, my code evolved through the milestones; however, there were times when I needed extra time to grasp the concepts of the topic. But I feel like I was able to do a better job every week. The process of iteration played a huge role in my development. For example, writing the code and copying and pasting the same functions helped me understand what I was really writing and trying to accomplish. In addition, I learned a new strategy from the course to comment on everything on the code, even if it was just a simple thing.  

**3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**

I’m not sure how computational graphics and visualization can be applied to my professional pathway. I’m concentrating on Information Security, and I do not know what is common between the career and the course. However, if I decide to change my career path into game development or other related careers, it will definitely help me be better. As far as my educational pathway, I’m sure if I have similar classes, I will apply what I have learned in the class and do an excellent job in my assignments.
